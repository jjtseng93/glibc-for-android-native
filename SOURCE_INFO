# Modifications
- These modifications are made in compliance with the Android app sandbox so no SIGSYS will occur to halt the application
- set_robust_list: comment out this syscall or fake success by returning value 0
- rseq(syscall 293, 0x125): comment out this syscall or simply return ENOSYS(-38)
- Binary patching to ld.so and libc.so.6 by dd: 
  * change the mov x8,0x125 to mov x0,ENOSYS and switch it with the next instruction
  * change the corresponding svc to nop
  * The binary patch is applied after build and does not alter the original glibc source tree.
